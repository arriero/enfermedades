# Minimal Dictionary

This project serves as a practical showcase of integrating the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) with the Flutter framework. The implementation follows the fundamental principles of the Business Logic Component (BloC) pattern, leveraging the powerful combination of [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) and [RxDart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) libraries.
